As a Teaching Assistant for the Web Programming Module, my primary objective is to support undergraduate students during lab sessions as they develop their skills in creating dynamic web applications. This module emphasizes both client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) scripting, covering a wide range of tools and technologies. My key responsibilities during the lab sessions include:

* Assisting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Helping students troubleshoot issues, understand best practices, and refine their skills in the essential building blocks of web development.
* Guiding students through JavaScript libraries: Offering support as students explore and implement jQuery and React, popular JavaScript libraries, to enhance the functionality and interactivity of their web applications.
* Supporting PHP implementation: Providing assistance in server-side scripting using PHP, helping students create robust and dynamic back-end components for their web applications.
* Helping with MySQL database management and SQL: Aiding students in effectively storing, managing, and retrieving data using the MySQL database management system and Structured Query Language (SQL) in their web applications.
* Clarifying AJAX concepts and usage: Assisting students as they work with AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML) using XMLHttpRequest and Fetch API, enabling them to create responsive and seamless user experiences in their web applications.

By actively engaging with students and providing comprehensive support during lab sessions, I strive to create a productive learning environment that nurtures students' passion for web development and equips them with the skills needed to excel in their future endeavors.
