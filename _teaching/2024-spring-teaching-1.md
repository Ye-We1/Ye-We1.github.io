<!-- As a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Vision Module, my primary objective is to support postgraduate students during lab sessions as they develop their skills in various image processing techniques. This module covers a wide range of topics, from basic image manipulation to advanced filtering and edge detection methods. My key responsibilities during the lab sessions include:

* Assisting with image processing tasks: Helping students understand and implement essential image processing techniques such as generating image negatives, adjusting image gamma, and performing histogram equalization and matching.
* Supporting students in using Matlab's image processing toolbox: Guiding students through the application of pre-built functions and tools in Matlab's toolbox, and helping them compare their custom implementations with built-in solutions.
* Aiding in implementing image filtering techniques: Providing assistance as students explore different spatial image filtering methods, such as mean and Gaussian filters, and guiding them in applying these filters to enhance and restore images.
* Facilitating edge detection and image sharpening: Assisting students in understanding and implementing edge detection methods, including the use of Laplacian filters, and helping them apply these techniques to sharpen images effectively.

By actively engaging with students and providing comprehensive support during lab sessions, I strive to create a productive learning environment that nurtures students' passion for computer vision and equips them with the skills needed to excel in their future endeavors. -->
