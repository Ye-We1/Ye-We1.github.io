As a Teaching Assistant for the Applied Machine Learning Module, my primary goal is to support postgraduate students in their journey to understand and master various machine learning techniques and their applications. I strive to create a stimulating and engaging learning environment, where students can develop their skills and knowledge in order to tackle real-world problems using both classical machine learning and deep learning methods. My key responsibilities during the course include:

* Clarifying complex concepts and principles related to machine learning, ensuring students fully comprehend the material and can effectively apply these techniques to diverse scenarios.
* Offering guidance and support during lab sessions, answering questions, and assisting students as they work with various machine learning tools and programming languages, such as Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.
* Providing constructive feedback on their lab works, including designing machine learning pipelines and working with Convolutional Neural Networks for image analysis, enabling students to refine their problem-solving and analytical skills.
* Encouraging collaborative learning and fostering an inclusive environment, where students feel comfortable sharing their ideas and asking questions, ultimately contributing to their academic and professional growth.

By actively engaging with students and providing comprehensive support, I aim to facilitate a productive learning experience that nurtures their passion for machine learning and prepares them for success in their future endeavors.
