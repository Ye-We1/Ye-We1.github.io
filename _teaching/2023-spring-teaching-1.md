As a Teaching Assistant for the Computer Animation Module at Loughborough University, I played an active role in supporting undergraduate students in their journey to understand and master the fundamentals of computer-generated animations. My main responsibilities during the course included:

* Providing guidance to students on the concepts and principles of widely-used computer animation algorithms, ensuring they were able to grasp the material effectively.
* Assisting students during lab sessions as they worked with MATLAB for programming, answering their questions, and helping them troubleshoot any issues they encountered.
* Facilitating an engaging and supportive learning environment that allowed students to experiment with different animation techniques and fostered their creativity and problem-solving skills.
