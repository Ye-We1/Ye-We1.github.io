This paper highlights the Traffic4cast 2022 competition, a platform leveraging machine learning to model intricate spatial systems over time. The competition emphasizes predicting future traffic states across entire road networks, utilizing sparse vehicle data from stationary detectors.

As enthusiastic participants, our team, ywei, achieved a commendable 7th place in the core challenge, demonstrating our inventive and efficacious approach to spatio-temporal prediction. A technical report detailing our simple, yet highly efficient model based on the [LinkX framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14446) can be found [here](https://github.com/Ye-We1/Traffic4cast2022/blob/master/paper.pdf). This model provides valuable insights into the potential of machine learning for addressing real-world traffic prediction challenges.
