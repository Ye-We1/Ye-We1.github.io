I recently ran into a problem when running my code on the [Joint Academic Data science Endeavour (JADE) facility](https://docs.jade.ac.uk/en/latest/).

When I import [torch-spline-conv](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_spline_conv), which is used in [pytorch_geomrtric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric), I get the following

> OSError: /lib64/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.27' not found (required by $\dots$/.conda/envs/t4c22/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch_spline_conv/_basis_cuda.so)


My environment is listed as follow:
+ OS: Linux
+ Python version: 3.9.10
+ PyTorch version: 1.11.0
+ CUDA version: 10.2
+ GCC version: 10.2
