Just to record [a very good explanation](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-neural-networks-a-learning-journey-since-2008-diffusion-convolutional-neural-networks-329d45471fd9) I found about Diffusion Convolutional Neural Networks. This technique has been widely used in spatio-temporal forecasting based on Graph Neural Networks.
