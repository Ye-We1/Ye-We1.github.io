## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Ye Wei, and I am currently a third-year PhD student at Loughborough University, where I am pursuing my passion for Computer Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of graph neural networks, time-series forecasting, spatial-temporal prediction, and mobility. As a dedicated researcher, I am driven by the desire to push the boundaries of our understanding in these areas, and to contribute to the advancement of technology that can have a profound impact on our daily lives.

## Research Interests

1. **Graph Neural Networks**: I am fascinated by the potential of graph neural networks to model complex relationships and patterns in structured data. My research in this area aims to develop novel algorithms and architectures to improve their efficiency and scalability for real-world applications.

2. **Time-Series Forecasting**: Accurate time-series forecasting is essential for a wide range of industries and applications. I am working on developing state-of-the-art models that can efficiently capture temporal patterns and provide reliable predictions for various domains, such as finance, climate, and traffic.

3. **Spatial-Temporal Prediction**: Understanding and predicting the dynamics of spatial-temporal data is a challenging yet crucial task. My research focuses on devising innovative methods to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in data, ultimately leading to more accurate predictions in areas like urban planning, transportation, and environmental monitoring.

4. **Mobility**: The study of human mobility patterns has significant implications for urban planning, transportation, and public health. I am interested in harnessing the power of data-driven approaches to uncover insights into human movement and behavior, which can be used to inform policy and improve our urban environments.

## Background

I began my academic journey with a strong foundation in Electrical and Computer Engineering, completing my Bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. During these years, I developed a keen interest in leveraging advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to address complex problems in the field.

## Collaborations and Goals

Throughout my academic career, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with researchers from diverse fields, including transportation and electronic, which has enriched my learning experience and allowed me to tackle complex interdisciplinary problems. I am always open to new collaborations and eager to explore innovative research ideas.

My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of cutting-edge technologies and methodologies that can help address the challenges our society faces today. By sharing my knowledge and findings through publications, presentations, and this website, I hope to inspire others in the field and foster a collaborative environment for continued innovation.
