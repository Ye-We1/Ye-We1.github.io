Welcome to my personal website!

I'm Ye Wei, a third-year PhD student at Loughborough University with a passion for traffic forecasting and spatio-temporal prediction. As a dedicated researcher, I'm driven to develop technologies that can make a positive impact on our daily lives.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I also gained valuable experience as a research assistant in the Advanced Network Laboratory and the Laboratory for Emerging Memory and Low Power Computing.

Recent highlights:

- October 2023: Became an [enrichment student](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/enrichment-students/ye-wei) at the Alan Turing Institute.
- December 2022: Our lightweight model achieved 7th place in the [NeurIPS 2022 Traffic4cast competition](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2022/competition/50080).
